Twitter scrapping using snscrape and streamlit and uploading to MongoDB.
This is my first project in the course of Data Science by GUVI.
This program uses the "snscrape" library to scrape the data from twitter.
The scraped data is then uploaded to MongoDB.
The "streamlit" is used to create a web app for "Twitter scrapping"
