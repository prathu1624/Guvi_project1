Twitter scrapping using snscrape and streamlit and uploading to MongoDB.
This is my first project in the course of Data Science by GUVI.
This program uses the "snscrape" library to scrape the data from twitter.
The scraped data is then uploaded to MongoDB.
The "streamlit" is used to create a web app for "Twitter scrapping"
You need to follow the below steps to run the program: -
These steps are according to the windows system.
First open "CMD" or Command Prompt in the system and install packages like "SNSCRAPE" and "STREAMLIT".
After installing these packages we will add our "MongoDB" link in the code in order to connect to the database.
Then we type the command "cd: directory where the program is saved".
Then we type the command "streamlit run filename.py".
After this the app opens in the browser where we can scrape data from twitter.
