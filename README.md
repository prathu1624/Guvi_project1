Twitter scrapping using snscrape and streamlit and uploading to MongoDB.
This is my first project from GUVI in the course of Data Science.
This program uses the "snscrape" library to scrape the data from twitter.
The scraped data can then be uploaded to MongoDB.
The "streamlit" is used to create a web app for "Twitter scrapping"
